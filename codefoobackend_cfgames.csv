Without the Caped Crusader, the Gotham City Police Department was overrun and outgunned by criminal gangs. Enter Jacob Kane (Dougray Scott) and his military-grade Crows Private Security, which now protects the city with omnipresent firepower and militia. Years before, Jacob’s first wife and daughter were killed in the crossfire of Gotham crime. He sent his only surviving daughter, Kate Kane, away from Gotham for her safety. After a dishonorable discharge from military school and years of brutal survival training, Kate returns home when the Alice in Wonderland gang targets her father and his security firm, by kidnapping his best Crow officer Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy). Although remarried to wealthy socialite Catherine Hamilton-Kane (Elizabeth Anweis), who bankrolls the Crows, Jacob is still struggling with the family he lost, while keeping Kate –– the daughter he still has –– at a distance. But Kate is a woman who’s done asking for permission. In order to help her family and her city, she’ll have to become the one thing her father loathes –– a dark knight vigilante.

In a city desperate for a savior, she must first overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham’s symbol of hope.","Expanding upon her introduction into the ""Arrowverse"", Batwoman is a TV series following crimefighter Kate Kane, better known by her hero alias Batwoman.

This unique and gripping doc series, directed and executive produced by true crime pioneer Joe Berlinger, focuses on the man whose personality, good looks and social graces defied the serial-killer stereotype, allowing him to hide in plain sight as he committed the brutal sex-crime slayings of more than 30 women before being caught in 1978.

Inspired the book of the same name written by Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth, the series utilizes over 100 hours of exclusive audio interviews that the two journalists conducted with Bundy on death row in 1980,  giving the unique perspective of hearing the killer analyze his own life and motives.","On the 30th anniversary of his Florida execution, Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes brings the infamously twisted mind of serial killer Ted Bundy into the light.",2019-01-16 03:13:54.644-08,2019-01-16 03:16:37.442-08,https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/26/netflixs-conversations-with-a-killer-the-ted-bundy-tapes-review,6.4,conversations-with-a-killer-the-ted-bundy-tapes,{Documentary},{},{Netflix.com},{},

Borrowing from the street mythology of 1970s Los Angeles, Moore assumes the persona of Dolemite, a pimp with a cane and an arsenal of obscene fables. However, his ambitions exceed selling bootleg records deemed too racy for mainstream radio stations to play.

Malcolm Bright (Tom Payne) has a gift. He knows how killers think, how their minds work. Why? Back in the 1990s, his father was one of the best, a notorious serial killer called ""The Surgeon."" That's why Bright is the best criminal psychologist around; murder is the family business. He will use his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers, all while dealing with a manipulative mother, annoyingly normal sister, a homicidal father still looking to bond with his prodigal son and his own constantly evolving neuroses. Meet the happy family. Dr. Martin Whitly (Michael Sheen) is intelligent, wealthy and charismatic, and also happens to be a predatory sociopath who killed at least 23 people. Bright's mother, Jessica Whitly (Bellamy Young), an elegant and WASPy New Yorker, wields sarcasm like a samurai sword and has an opinion on every aspect of Bright's life. Perhaps Bright's only ally is his sister, Ainsley Whitly (Halston Sage), a TV journalist who wishes her brother would ""take a break from murder"" and have a normal life. Unfortunately for his sister, the only way Bright feels normal is by solving cases with the help of his longtime mentor, NYPD Detective Gil Arroyo (Lou Diamond Phillips). Arroyo's one of the best detectives around, and he expects no less from his team - Detective Dani Powell (Aurora Perrineau), a headstrong no-nonsense cop who quickly becomes impressed with Bright's work; and Detective JT Tarmel (Frank Harts), a born-and-bred New Yorker who questions whether Bright is a psychopath himself.

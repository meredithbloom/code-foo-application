# Code Foo IGN Application Pt 2
## Hisui's New Power Plant
Meredith Bloom

Requested By: Professor Laventon

The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, [Jubilife village](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jubilife_City) needs a brand new power plant. Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, [Voltorb](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_(Pok%C3%A9mon)), is the best candidate to help power the village.

Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

**Objective:** How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.


**Questions and subsequent thought process:**

1. How much electricity do we need to produce to fully power Jubilife Village?
    - How many people live in Jubilife village?
    - What are the largest electricity sucks in Jubilife Village? Are there particular neighborhoods that require more electricity than others?
        + Jubilife TV
        + Global Trade Station / Global Terminal
        + Global Wonder Station
        + Poketech Company
        + Trainers' School
        + Jubilife Condominiums
    - How does need for electricity fluctuate over the course of a day? What about over a week?
        + Electricity use might be highest between 7PM-midnight
        + Electricity use might be higher on the weekends
        + Electricity use is higher in the Summer (AC) and Winter (heat)
        + Need for electricity spikes around major events, especially those that are televised (i.e. major Pokemon tournaments)

2. How much electricity does the average Voltorb produce? 
    - How long can a Voltorb produce electricity before needing to rest/recharge? (only humane Pokemon treatment here :innocent: Voltorbs deserve PTO too!!)
        + There are Voltorbs that are of below average, or even especially small size. Should we require Voltorbs utilized to meet a minimum size requirement? If not, we need to account for how minor differences between electricity production for Voltorbs of varying size might stack?
    - Will Voltorbs only be producing electricity in real time, or is there some way to store excess electricity created (i.e. like solar panels on sunny days)?
        + Related to fluctuations in energy demand - will more Voltorbs need to be "on duty" during high demand times? Or can we find some way to store produced electricity without losing too much of the energy in transfer?
    - What infrastructure for the distribution of energy currently exists?
        + Does Jubilife Village have multiple power plants? If so, where are they located and what amount of energy are they each responsible for producing?



Given the Pokemon universe bears striking (and intentional) resemblance to real places, I wanted to see if Jubilife Village was based on a real city. According to [this link](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_world_in_relation_to_the_real_world), Jubilife Village appears to be based on [Sapporo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo), the largest city on Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan. I tried to find a value for the amount of electricity that Sapporo consumes, but wasn't able to find anything conclusive for the city as a whole. But what if I look at electricity use per person?


According to the [Jubilife Village Bulbapedia wiki page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Jubilife_City), in Pokemon Platinum Jubilife Village is the fourth largest city in the Pokemon world, with a population of 124. This doesn't account for tourists, of which Jubilife Village likely has many. But for the sake of finding a flat number to work off of, I'll say 124. How much does electricity does each person use?


According to [this link](https://www.worlddata.info/asia/japan/energy-consumption.php), Japan's per capita electricity consumption is ~7.5k kWh (per person, per year). Multiply that by 124 (the population of Jubilife Village) and you get 930,000 kWh. So I'll say that we need to be able to produce just under 1 million kWh of electricity to fully power Jubilife Village (leaving some wiggle room for major events) for a year.


Given a Pokemon's rarity seems to positively correlate with that Pokemon's strength, Voltorbs are probably pretty strong. To make sure our Voltorb employees get adequate time off of work, I'll estimate that a single Voltorb can produce 120k kWh of electricity over the course of a year, 10k kWh a month, with relative ease. If a single Voltorb can produce 120k kWh of electricity a year, we need, at minimum (rounding up to nearest whole number) 9 Voltorbs to fully power Jubilife Village. Just to be safe, let's keep 10 Voltorbs on staff for our new power plant. 


From a realistic engineering perspective, we'd probably have to use some kind of differential equation(s) to calculate the number of Voltorbs needed to fully power Jubilife Village, and what their shifts would have to be, etc.. But my high school calculus class has all but disappeared in my rear view mirror, so this will have to do :smiley:.
